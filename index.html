        <h3>Image Prediction model</h3>
        </li>
        <p>This is an project based on Image prediction , I made this using cifar 10 dataset and the model is trained well and outputs images with 70-80% of accuracy.
        Image prediction model:The Image Prediction Project is a machine learning/computer vision–based system that can identify and classify objects, patterns, or features within an image. It uses image datasets to train a model so that the system learns how to recognize visual patterns. After training, when a new image is given as input, the system predicts what the image represents (for example, a cat, dog, car, digit, or even medical scan category).</p>
